In a class, there are n students and their tutor wants to divide them into two groups and puts a quiz between them. He can conduct quizzes for not more than 20 days. 
He wants to conduct a quiz between them such that each student must have played against the remaining students in at least one of the days. Student A played against student B if they are in opposites team in at least one of the days. 
So he wants to finish this business as early as possible. And he is also happy if he can complete it in lesser than 20 days. Please help him to achieve it. 


Input: N  (Number of students) where 2 <= N <= 1000000 and N is even.


Output: k(the number of days required such that the tutor desire satisfied)
print k lines where each line will contain n integers t1,t2,t3,.......,tn where 
ti = 0 if he belongs to team1 on that day.
ti = 1 if he belongs to team2 on that day.


Solution.
To represent N numbers uniquely in binary we require at least log(N) bits.
log(1000000) <= 20. and 2 numbers will differ at least in 1 position so on that day they are in different teams. 

Example: 
Input  8
Output 3
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
